    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My family LOVES bread pudding, and this recipe is one that I have fine
      tuned to their taste. I have to double this recipe, and bake it in a 9x13
      inch pan for my family! It's great for breakfast or dessert and is
      delicious with milk poured on top! Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 slices day-old bread</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Break bread into small pieces into an 8 inch square baking pan. Drizzle
        melted butter or margarine over bread. If desired, sprinkle with
        raisins.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, and
        vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down
        with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top springs back
        when lightly tapped.
