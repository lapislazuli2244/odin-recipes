    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tangy cranberry, creamy brie, and crunchy walnuts come together in a
      buttery shell for an appetizer that will wow your guests. Bonus: These can
      be made up to 3 days ahead; wrap them in plastic wrap before the baking
      step and store in the refrigerator. Serve warm or at room temperature.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) round Brie cheese, rind removed</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>½ cup cranberry sauce</li>
      <li>⅓ cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place Brie cheese in the freezer for 20 minutes. Oil a mini muffin pan
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll 1 puff pastry sheet out into a 10x14-inch rectangle. Cut the sheet
        lengthwise into 4 even strips and crosswise into 6 even strips; there
        should be 24 squares. Separate and press them gently into the muffin
        cups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut chilled Brie cheese into 24 pieces approximately 3/4-inch in size.
        Add 1 teaspoon cranberry sauce to each pastry-lined muffin cup; press in
        1 piece of Brie and top with 1 teaspoon of chopped walnuts. Sprinkle
        bites with sea salt. Chill for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake bites in the preheated oven until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
